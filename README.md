## Installation

This R package is being developed in support of the analysis in [`multi-agyw`](https://github.com/athowes/multi-agyw).
For this reason, many of the functions are relatively unlikely to be of great general use.
This disclaimer given, the package can be installed via:

```r
devtools::install_github("athowes/multi-agyw")
```
